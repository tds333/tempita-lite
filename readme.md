Tempita-lite
------------

A small templating language for text substitution.
Tempita was originally authored by [Ian Bicking](https://bitbucket.org/ianb).

This is a modified and partly rewritten lite version with less
functionality but better for embedding and easier to use.

It isn't intended to be the Next Big Thing in templating, just a
handy little templating language for when a project outgrows
string.Template or {} substitution.

It's small, simple, extendable and it is only one file.
